Text-Suite
==========

A suite of text-related editors and readers.

Dictionary & Simple Editor write/read to/from the directory they are placed in.
Note: Simple Editor files are best viewed with dictionary. They are also fine with a text editor with word wrap.
custom_dictionary is best for card-catalog type things, because it stores text files in a list. Thus, I would
recommend having basic knowledge of sequences.
